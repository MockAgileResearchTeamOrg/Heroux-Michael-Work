## Michael Heroux, PhD student, individual project work

This mock repo illustrates how to manage and retain the work of a research student or post-doc, or any team member who is categorically "transient".  Of course, any team member can have such a repo, but it is particularly important to have this repo for those team members who are expected to come to the project, make a strong contribution, and then depart in a few years to a new situation.

### What should be kept in this repo

This repo should be used to capture artifacts related to an individual's daily research activities and individual products.  Individual notes from research meetings, annotated bibliographies and, of course, a thesis or dissertation, are good examples.

### What should not be kept in this repo

This repo is *only* for content that does not belong elsewhere.  Any direct project contributions to papers, software products, etc., should be kept in team-scoped repos.
